Data Storage
 1. in files (only text, no audio, no video, no pics)
 2. in database (we can store all type of data in a efficient way)

Types of DB:
    1. SQL (store data in tables)
    2. NoSQL (stores data in objects)
MySQL (SQL):
MongoDB (NoSQL):

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It allows developers to interact with a relational database using the object-oriented paradigm of their programming language. ORMs map database tables to classes and database records to instances of those classes. 

Object-Document Mapping (ODM) is similar to ORM but is used for document-oriented databases, such as NoSQL databases. ODM allows developers to interact with document databases using an object-oriented approach, mapping document structures to classes and document instances to objects. This is particularly useful for databases that store data in formats like JSON or BSON.
